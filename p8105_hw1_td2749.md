**Loading the required packages:**

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```

## Problem 1

``` r
install.packages("palmerpenguins")
```

Loading the `penguins` dataset from the `palmerpenguins` package:

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

***Dataset Description***

The given dataset consists of information regarding penguins from the
years 2007-2009. It holds **344 rows and 8 columns**. The columns
contain data pertaining to *‘species, island, bill_length_mm,
bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, sex, year’*. Data
recordings for bill length, bill depth, and flipper length are made in
millimeters (mm). body_mass is recorded in grams (g). The species
include *‘Adelie, Gentoo, Chinstrap’* from the *‘Torgersen, Biscoe,
Dream’* islands. The mean flipper length recorded for the listed
penguins is **200.92 mm** (millimeters).

NOTE: 2 rows from the `penguin` dataframe with NA values in the
`flipper_length_mm` column were omitted to perform the above mean
calculation.

***Filpper Length Vs. Bill Length: Visualization Via Scatterplot***

``` r
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + geom_point()
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (geom_point).

``` r

```

## Problem 2

``` r
df_2 = 
  tibble(
    norm_vec = rnorm(10),
    log_vec = norm_vec > 0,
    char_vec = c("I", "love", "listening", "to", "Seventeen", "NCT", "Treasure", "and", "BTS", "!"),
    fac_vec = factor(c("NYC", "SD", "LA", "LA", "SD", "SD", "SD", "NYC", "NYC", "NYC"))
  )
```

***Taking means of each variable***

``` r
#Mean of numerical values
mean(pull(df_2, norm_vec))
```

    ## [1] -0.3978478

``` r
#Mean of logical values
mean(pull(df_2, log_vec))
```

    ## [1] 0.3

``` r
#Mean of character values
mean(pull(df_2, char_vec))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(df_2, char_vec)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
#Mean of vector values
mean(pull(df_2, fac_vec))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(df_2, fac_vec)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

Based on the above results, it is possible to take means of numeric and
logical values but not of character or factor values.

``` r
log_num = as.numeric(df_2$log_vec)
char_num = as.numeric(df_2$char_vec)
fac_num = as.numeric(df_2$fac_vec)
```

Calling `as.numeric` on the logical values converts them into zeroes
(FALSE) and ones (TRUE). This explains why it is possible to run the
`mean` function on the logical vector. Character values on the other
hand don’t seem to be getting converted into numeric values. Calling
`as.numeric` on them throws up a ‘Warning Message’ of *“NAs introduced
by coercion”*. Character values not being able to be converted to
numbers explains why it is not possible to call the `mean` function on a
character vector. Upon being called with `as.numeric`, factor values are
getting converted into numeric representations of the number of classes
in the vector in context. As the numeric representation only seems to be
functioning as some sort of identification aspect rather than actually
converting the factor values into numbers, it makes sense that there is
no possibility of calling their mean. From a reasoning perspective,
calling the mean of a logical vector gives an indication of the
proportion of TRUE and FALSE values present in it (as they are only 0s
and 1s so a 0.7 mean recorded from a collection of 10 values indicates
the presence of 7 TRUEs). However, there is not much that can be
inferred from the mean calculated from the as.numeric converted factor
values as they would widely differ based on the number of classes and
values present and offer no specific information regarding the factor
vector in reference.
